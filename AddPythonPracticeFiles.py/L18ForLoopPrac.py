# focusing on For loops
# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
# you can iterate over a range, str, sequence, ect.
# basic syntax
#for i in range(1, 11):
#    print(i)
#creditCardNum = "1234-3456-6879-5670"
#for i in creditCardNum:
#    print(i)
    
#print("Happy new year!")
# or practice with while loops:
for i in range(1 , 21):
    if i == 13:
        # continue keyword used to go to the next item
        #continue
        break # and break is used to stop it
    else:
        print(i)
